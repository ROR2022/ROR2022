Hello, I'm Ramiro Ocampo:

I am a developer with experience in Node.js and React.js, and I am looking for opportunities to work on projects involving these technologies. My passion for web development and commitment to continuous improvement have led me to specialize in these key areas of modern development.

Currently, I am taking an intensive course on Microservices with Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Next.js, Nest.js and Continuous Deployment on AWS. This course is providing me with advanced knowledge in creating, managing, and scaling applications using microservices, as well as utilizing containers and orchestrators to ensure efficient and robust deployments in the cloud.

I am interested in collaborating remotely, either on a permanent basis or per project, with a national or international company. I firmly believe in the potential of remote work to connect with diverse teams and work on challenging projects regardless of geographic location. My goal is to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative and high-impact projects.

In addition to Node.js and React.js, I have experience in developing RESTful APIs, managing databases such as MongoDB and SQL, and knowledge of frontend and backend technologies that complement my profile as a full-stack developer. I am passionate about learning new technologies and development methodologies, and I always strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends.

I am available to discuss opportunities and collaborate on interesting projects. You can contact me via WhatsApp at +52 833 299 8900 or by email at rami.ror279@gmail.com. I look forward to contributing to exciting projects and being part of dynamic and creative teams.
